# Optimization Demos
A series of demos on combinatorial optimization designed to help software developers
learn the basics of Constraint Programming, along with Linear and Mixed-Integer Programming.

## Bss.Optimization.Appetizers.sln
An implementation of a very simple, knapsack-style solution to the problem described
in [XKCD 287](http://xkcd.com/287). 

 
## Bss.Optimization.Pottery.sln
Two solution implementations for the Pete's Pottery Paradise problem described in the
presentation, [A Developer's Guide to Finding Optimal Solutions](http://1drv.ms/1QqBcbh).
