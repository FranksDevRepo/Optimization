# Optimization Demos
A series of demos on combinatorial optimization designed to help software developers
learn the basics of Constraint Programming, along with Linear and Mixed-Integer Programming.

## Bss.Optimization.Appetizers.sln
An implementation of a very simple, knapsack-style solution to the problem described
in [XKCD 287](http://xkcd.com/287). 

 
## Bss.Optimization.Pottery.sln
Two solution implementations for the Pete's Pottery Paradise problem described in the
presentation, [A Developer's Guide to Finding Optimal Solutions](http://1drv.ms/1QqBcbh). 
Both solutions exist within the confines of a single Visual Studio solution file.

**Note: To switch between the naive and LP optimizers, uncomment the appropriate 
implementation in the Create method found in the 
Bss.Optimization.Pottery.Test.Extensions.cs file.**

###Naive Solution
Traverses the entire possible search-space attempting to locate feasible solutions, 
then searches all feasible solutions to determine the optimal solution.  This implementation
fails when the search space is very large.

###LP Optimization using the Gurobi Solver
Uses a Linear Program with linear constraints and a linear objective, along with integer 
variables to determine the optimal solution. This implementation works well even with an
extremely large search space.
